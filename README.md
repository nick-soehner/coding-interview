# Hello!
Welcome to my code interview challenge!  
I had an absolue **BLAST** recreating this project.  
I hope it surpasses your expectations and enjoy my project!

## About the project
- *project was built to match mockup size of 1440x1024*  
- Project was created from scratch using Bootstrap and plain HTML, CSS, and JS.    
- Animations are made using JavaScript mutations and CSS animations.    
- Project is responsive on all devices, which includes changing orientation of social links to fit the screen on smaler devices.  
- Plain JS was used and no JQuery was included (even though I find it easier and more efficient)
- No other libraries or frameworks used besides Bootstrap
